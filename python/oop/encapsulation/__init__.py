"""Encapsulation in Python is like putting things in a box. Imagine you have a box with a secret compartment inside.
You can put your valuable items inside the secret compartment and close the box. Now, nobody can directly access or
modify those items unless they know the special way to open the secret compartment.

In programming, encapsulation is similar. You can create a class in Python, which acts as the box. The class holds
your data (like variables) and methods (like functions) that operate on that data. By default, the data and methods
inside the class are hidden from the outside world.

To interact with the data and methods inside the class, you define special methods called getters and setters. These
methods provide controlled access to the data. Just like knowing the special way to open the secret compartment in
the box, you need to use the getters and setters to access or modify the data inside the class.

Encapsulation has a few advantages:

Protection: It helps protect your data from being accidentally changed or accessed inappropriately. Only the methods
defined in the class can manipulate the data, ensuring its integrity.

Simplicity: Encapsulation hides the complexity of how things work inside the class. Users of the class only need to
know the public methods and their purposes. They don't need to understand the inner details of the implementation.

Organization: Encapsulation allows you to organize your code better. You can group related data and methods together
in a class, making it easier to manage and maintain your code.

By using encapsulation, you can keep your data safe, make your code easier to understand, and have better control
over how your objects are accessed and modified in Python."""
