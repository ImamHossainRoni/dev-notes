##### âœ… Factory Pattern:
<p>The Factory Pattern is a way to create objects without letting the client (the code that uses those objects) know how they're made. It keeps things flexible by separating the client from the details of object creation, so the client just asks for an object, and the factory takes care of the rest. This makes the code easier to work with and change later on</p>
